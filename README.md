## General Info

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation for automatic license plate recognition. It utilizes image processing techniques to locate, segment, and recognize characters from license plates in RGB images.
The application takes an RGB image of a car as input and outputs the recognised letters of the license plate as well as the federal state if it is an Austrian license plate.
